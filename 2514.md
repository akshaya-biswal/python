# Count Occurrences of Anagrams

- The loop iterates over the text starting from the end of the first window.
- For each new character entering the window (text[i]), increment its count in window_count.
- Compare window_count with pattern_count. If they are equal, it means the current window is an anagram of the pattern.
- Remove the character that is sliding out of the window (text[i-k+1]). If its count drops to zero, remove it from window_count to keep the comparison efficient.
- Increment the result count whenever window_count matches pattern_count.
