# Approach

- Hash Map for Last Index: Use a hash map to store the last occurrence of each element.
- Two Pointers: Use two pointers, i and j. Pointer i iterates through the array, and j is updated to the farthest last occurrence of the elements seen so far.
- Counting Partitions: Whenever i exceeds j, it indicates a valid partition point, and we double the number of good partitions (since we can split the current partition or not).
