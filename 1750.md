# Explanation

- Initialize Two Pointers: Start with one pointer (left) at the beginning of the string and another pointer (right) at the end of the string.
- Move Pointers Inward: While the characters at the left and right pointers are the same:
  - Move the left pointer to the right.
  - Move the right pointer to the left.
- Repeat Deletion: After moving the pointers, if the characters at the new positions are still the same, repeat the process.
- Calculate Remaining Length: Once the characters at the pointers are different, the remaining length of the string is right - left + 1.
