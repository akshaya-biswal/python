# Explanation

- Sort the Array: Sorting the array allows us to use a two-pointer technique effectively.
- Two Pointers: Use two pointers, left starting from the beginning of the array and right starting from the end.
- Check Sum Condition:
  - If the sum of nums[left] and nums[right] is less than or equal to target, all subsequences between left and right are valid because adding any element between left and right will still keep the smallest and largest elements as nums[left] and nums[right].
  - If the condition is satisfied, move the left pointer to the right.
  - If the condition is not satisfied, move the right pointer to the left.
- Count Subsequences: Use the property of powers of 2 to count subsequences. If there are n elements between left and right, there are 2^(right-left) valid subsequences.
