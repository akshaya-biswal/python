# Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future. In such cases, we can use the pass statement.
# This can be used inside Function or Class

# Example 1
n = 10
if n > 10:
    pass

print("Hello")  # It will work

# Example 2
m = 10
if m > 10:
    pass

# print('Hello') # It will show an error if we comment pass
